APPLICATIONS
#############
   Cluster DX986_cluster provides the following applications: dbscript 
      Application: dbscript
         dbscript is started by /usr/es/sbin/cluster/scripts/dbstart.sh
         dbscript is stopped by /usr/es/sbin/cluster/scripts/dbstop.sh
         No application monitors are configured for dbscript.
         This application is part of resource group 'DX986_RSG'.
            Resource group policies:
               Startup: on home node only
               Fallover: to next priority node in the list
               Fallback: never
            State of dbscript: online
            Nodes configured to provide dbscript: DX986 {up}  DX987 {up}  
               Node currently providing dbscript: DX986 {up} 
               The node that will provide dbscript if DX986 fails is: DX987
