   Cluster DX979_cluster provides the following applications: dbscripts 
      Application: dbscripts
         dbscripts is started by /usr/es/sbin/cluster/scripts/dbstart.sh
         dbscripts is stopped by /usr/es/sbin/cluster/scripts/dbstop.sh
         No application monitors are configured for dbscripts.
         This application is part of resource group 'DX979_RSG'.
            Resource group policies:
               Startup: on home node only
               Fallover: to next priority node in the list
               Fallback: never
            State of dbscripts: online
            Nodes configured to provide dbscripts: DX979 {up}  DX980 {up}  
               Node currently providing dbscripts: DX979 {up} 
               The node that will provide dbscripts if DX979 fails is: DX980
