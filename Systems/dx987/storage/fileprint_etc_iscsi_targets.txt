# Comments may be used in the file, the comment character is '#', 0x23.  
# Anything from a comment char to the end of the line is ignored.
#
# Blank lines are ignored.
#
# The format for a target line is defined according to the Augmented BNF 
# syntax as # described in rfc2234.
#
# The format for the IPv4Address is taken from rfc2373.
#
# The line continuation character '\' (i.e., back-slash) can be used to make
# each TargetLine easier to read. To ensure no parsing errors, the '\' 
# character must be the last character and must be preceeded by white space.

# EXAMPLE 1: iSCSI Target without CHAP(MD5) authentication
#	Assume the target is at address 192.168.3.2,
#	the valid port is 5003
#	the name of the target is iqn.com.ibm-4125-23WTT26
# The target line would look like:
# 192.168.3.2 5003 iqn.com.ibm-4125-23WWT26

# EXAMPLE 2: iSCSI Target with CHAP(MD5) authentication
#	Assume the target is at address 10.2.1.105
#	the valid port is 3260
#	the name of the target is iqn.com.ibm-K167-42.fc1a
#	the CHAP secret is "This is my password."

# EXAMPLE 3: iSCSI Target with CHAP(MD5) authentication and line continuation
