#	This is the extrainfo.txt file - you need to update it by hand.
#	Things you put in here are used by the analysis tool to tell it things you'd
#	like for the tool use in reports.  Anything you put in here will go in the
#	server table for the report.
#	Things you might want to put in here include:
#	RAID=RAID level
#	Role=Web Server
#	Site=Mexico
#	Cluster=SAP Cluster
#		Cluster is special to the analysis tool
#		and will be used for doing consistency checking.
#		If this machine belongs to a cluster you should indicate that in this file.
