Summary     : The GNU Bourne Again shell (bash).
Description :
The GNU bash shell is a command language interpreter that attempts
compatibility with the Bourne shell (sh).  Bash incorporates useful features
from the Korn shell (ksh) and the C shell (csh).  Most sh scripts can be run by
bash without modification.  Bash is intended to be a conformant implementation
of the IEEE Posix Shell and Tools specification (IEEE Working Group 1003.2).

URL         : http://www.gnu.org/software/cpio
Summary     : A GNU archiving program.
Description :
GNU cpio copies files into or out of a cpio or tar archive.  Archives
are files which contain a collection of other files plus information
about them, such as their file name, owner, timestamps, and access
permissions.  The archive can be another file on the disk, a magnetic
tape, or a pipe.  GNU cpio supports the following archive formats:  binary,
old ASCII, new ASCII, crc, HPUX binary, HPUX old ASCII, old tar and POSIX.1
tar.  By default, cpio creates binary format archives, so that they are
compatible with older cpio programs.  When it is extracting files from
archives, cpio automatically recognizes which kind of archive it is reading
and can read archives created on machines with a different byte-order.

Install cpio if you need a program to manage file archives.

Summary     : Allows restricted root access for specified users.
Description :
Sudo (superuser do) allows a system administrator to give certain users (or
groups of users) the ability to run some (or all) commands as root while
logging all commands and arguments. Sudo operates on a per-command basis.  It
is not a replacement for the shell.  Features include: the ability to restrict
what commands a user may run on a per-host basis, copious logging of each
command (providing a clear audit trail of who did what), a configurable timeout
of the sudo command, and the ability to use the same configuration file
(sudoers) on many different machines.

Description :
The unzip utility is used to list, test, or extract files from a zip archive.
Zip archives are commonly found on MS-DOS systems.  The zip utility, included

with archives created by PKWARE(R)'s PKZIP for MS-DOS, but the programs'
options and default behaviors do differ in some respects.
